# Pixel Art Maker Project

This Pixel Art Maker was for the Grow with Google Udacity final project. It was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JQuery).
The Main HTML was provided by Udacity and then I added to it. I added all of the JavaScript and CSS and changed up the HTML.

The starter code was for _all_ Udacity students. I likely will not accept pull requests.
